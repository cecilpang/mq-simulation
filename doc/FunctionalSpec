To simulate this SLA:

overall message size 1-5K
no limitations on comments/posts
20K of messages per day generated by 200 users
supports 15-20 messages per second
expected latency upon replication is <1sec

This is to be performed:

RabbitMQ:
One fanout Exchange
200 queues bound to the exchange

Akka:
An Actor that publishes messages to the exchange
An Actor that listens to messages from a queue
An sender that schedule 20 messages to be sent to the publishing actor every second

The message contains a timestamp on when it was sent.  On receipt, the receiver checks that the latency is < 1sec
