SLA requested by LP:

overall message size 1-5K
no limitations on comments/posts
20K of messages per day generated by 200 users
supports 15-20 messages per second
expected latency upon replication is <1sec

Simulator does this:

RabbitMQ:
One fanout Exchange
200 queues bound to the exchange

Akka:
An Actor that publishes messages to the exchange
Use Akka scheduler to invoke the actor to publish 20 msg / second
200 listeners listen to messages from 200 queues

The message contains a timestamp on when it was sent.  On receipt, the receiver calculate the latency
